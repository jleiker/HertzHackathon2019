# HertzHackathon2019
Developed within 24 hours. Neural network written during Hertz Hackathon 2019 using Python and MXNet, the model detects whether a driver's license is being shown or not. An AWS Lambda function would then use this to extract information from the license, such as name, DOB, etc.

Unfortunately I was not able to recover the Lambda function written during the event, so only the neural network is uploaded here.
